# ONTOLOGY.md — Personal Alignment Map

*This document maps your belief system from the ground up — purpose, assumptions, predictions, core identity, and goals. Everything routes through it. The point is not to be comprehensive; it's to be honest.*

*Fill in sections you're confident about. Leave others as `[to be defined]` — an honest blank beats a performative answer.*

---

## Higher Order

*What is the ultimate purpose underlying everything you do? This is the "why" behind the "why."*

> [Your Higher Order purpose — e.g. "To understand and explain reality more clearly" or "To build a life where creativity and meaning compound together"]

---

## Beliefs

*Foundational assumptions you hold to be true. These shape how you interpret everything else.*

- [Belief 1]
- [Belief 2]
- [Belief 3]

*Examples: "Most problems are coordination problems." / "Compounding is underrated in every domain." / "Systems beat willpower every time."*

---

## Predictions

*Testable hypotheses about how the world will unfold. Include a timeframe so they can be evaluated.*

| Prediction | Timeframe | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| [Your prediction] | [by when] | open |

*Examples: "AI coding tools will handle 80% of typical web dev by 2027." / "Newsletter revenue will exceed $X by Q4."*

---

## Core Self

### Mission

*What you're here to do. One or two sentences.*

> [Your mission — e.g. "Build systems that help people think more clearly and act more deliberately"]

### Values

1. [Value 1]
2. [Value 2]
3. [Value 3]

---

## Goals

*Time-bound objectives that follow from your Mission. Each should be achievable within 1-2 years.*

| Goal | Target | Timeframe |
|------|--------|-----------|
| [Goal 1] | [Measurable outcome] | [by when] |
| [Goal 2] | [Measurable outcome] | [by when] |

---

## Portfolios & Projects

*High-level map of active work areas. Detail lives in Project Boards.*

| Portfolio | Description | Goal Link |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| [Portfolio 1] | [What this bucket is] | [Goal it serves] |
| [Portfolio 2] | [What this bucket is] | [Goal it serves] |

## How Your Assistant Uses This File

1. **Project creation:** checks if the project connects to a Goal before proceeding
2. **Prioritization:** uses Goals to rank what matters most
3. **Decision support:** checks Values when you're at a fork
4. **Weekly health check:** flags orphan work (projects not connected to any Goal)
5. **Reflection routing:** insights from sessions route back here (belief updates, new goals, etc.)

---

*Update this file when something important shifts — a belief changes, a goal is achieved or dropped, a new prediction crystallizes. It should feel slightly uncomfortable to update — that means it's actually tracking something real.*
